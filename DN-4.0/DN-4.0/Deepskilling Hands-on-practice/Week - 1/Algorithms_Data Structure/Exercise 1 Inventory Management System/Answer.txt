Discuss how you can optimize these operations?
Ans:
Ensure productId is unique to prevent overwrites.

If sorting or range queries are needed, consider using TreeMap instead of HashMap (which gives O(log n) operations with sorted keys).

Add indexing or separate maps by categories for faster filtered searches if required later.

2)Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Ans:
Efficient handling of large inventories in a warehouse system is critical for real-time operations like:
Adding, updating, or removing products

Searching for a product quickly

Generating reports and summaries

Without good data structures and algorithms, these operations can become slow and inefficient, especially as the number of products grows into the thousands or millions.

3)Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Ans:
For managing inventory, data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeMap are commonly used.

ArrayList is good for maintaining an ordered list of products but is slower for searching.

HashMap is ideal because it allows fast access, update, and deletion using the product ID as the key.

TreeMap is useful when you need to keep the products sorted by ID.
