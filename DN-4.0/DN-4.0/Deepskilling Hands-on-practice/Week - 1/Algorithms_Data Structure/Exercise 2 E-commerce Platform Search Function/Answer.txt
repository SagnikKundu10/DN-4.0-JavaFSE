1)Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why ?
Ans:
Binary search is more suitable for e-commerce platforms where performance is key, assuming product lists are kept sorted or are searchable via pre-sorted indexes e.g., databases.

2)Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Ans:
Big O describes the upper bound of time or space an algorithm uses based on input size n.

It helps compare algorithms' efficiency, especially with large datasets.

3)Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Ans:
Search Type	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)
Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)
