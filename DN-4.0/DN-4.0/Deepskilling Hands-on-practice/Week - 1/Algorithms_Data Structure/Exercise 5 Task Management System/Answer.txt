1)Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
Ans:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next. One-way traversal.

Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both next and previous. Two-way traversal, easier deletion.

2)Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
Ans:
 Operation  Time Complexity 
 ---------  --------------- 
 Add (end)  O(n)            
 Search     O(n)            
 Traverse   O(n)            
 Delete     O(n)            

3)Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.
Ans:
Dynamic size: No need to define a fixed size.

Efficient insertion/deletion: No shifting required.

Memory: Efficient if elements are frequently added/removed.
