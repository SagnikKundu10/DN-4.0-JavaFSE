1)Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
Ans:
Arrays are stored contiguously in memory.

Each element can be accessed directly using its index â†’ O(1) access time.

Memory is allocated statically, which means fixed size.

2) Time Complexity of Operations:
Operation	Time Complexity
Add (at end)	O(1)
Search	        O(n)
Traverse	O(n)
Delete (by ID)	O(n)

3)Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
Ans:
 Limitations of Arrays
Fixed Size: You must define the size in advance.

Inefficient Deletion: Requires shifting elements.


>>When to Use Arrays
When we know the maximum number of elements.

When fast indexed access is more important than flexibility.
